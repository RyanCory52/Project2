# Project2: The Game Of Set
How to start the game:

    In the terminal of your computer, enter "ruby main.rb" in order to run the game
    
How the game is played:

    The game will ask the users, "please enter the names of each user", one at a time, with a return entered after you are done entering your name. The game will then provide you with a quick explanation on how the order of the players is created, as well as who's turn it is first. The game is set in a 3 x 4 table. The top row will be cards 1, 2, and 3. The second row from top will be cards 4, 5, and 6 and so on. In order to submit a set, input the number of the card followed by a space, and then the next cards. Ex: "1 5 12". When you are done submitting your list of cards that you believe are a "set", press enter or return. If you can't find a "set" before 10 seconds are up, then your turn is over and it is now the other players turn. In order to quit the game, in the command line in the terminal, type "end". At the end of the game, the score will be presented to the user to see who won.
