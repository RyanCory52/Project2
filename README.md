To run the application, run "ruby main.rb". The game should start automatically

How to play:

The computer will randomly generate how to play. A set is described as a collection of cards with only 1 quality in common. For example, you can have a collection of cards that all have the number 1, but can't have any qualities that are the same. So if you find 3 cards that you believe to be a set because all cards have the number 1, but 2 of the three cards have the same shape, square, then they are not a set. The computer will generate a new board for every new turn. The cards will be placed in 4 rows of 3. In order to submit what cards you think is a set, you must put the appropriate card numbers on the command line, seperated by a space. Please do not include leading spaces, or spaces at the end of your input. The corresponding card numbers will be shown at the end of the Readme. In order to quit the game, please input "quit" in to the command line and the game will end. When the game ends, a scoreboard will be presented to the user so the players can tell who won.
